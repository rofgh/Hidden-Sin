    # SRs/GRABBER
        The grabber script allows us to look at the SRs for a specific set of parameter settings.
        
        The flat.txt file needs to be saved in the SRs file, as it is too big to put on GitHub

        Then the script is run by with the following "python 0001110001110 0 0" 
        the first 13 digit argument is the list of parameter settings
        the second argument is whether you want UR bracketed representations to be printed
        the third argument is whether you want the list to have gaps where the SRs are missing for that
        language (i.e. for that set of parameters)
